				As with any relationship, it is important to maintain your engagements
				to protect your reputation and continue bringing in new bookings.
				Of course, things come up and you may need to adjust your calendar from time to time.
				If this happens, please contact the artist or venue directly as soon as possible
				in order to reschedule your booking. We reserve the right to discontinue service
				for artists or venues who do not maintain their commitments.
