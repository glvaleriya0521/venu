				As with any relationship, it is important to maintain your engagements 
				to protect your reputation and continue bringing in new bookings. 
				Of course, things come up and you may need to adjust your calendar from time to time. 
				If this happens, please contact the artist or venue directly as soon as possible 
				in order to reschedule your booking. We reserve the right to discontinue service 
				for artists or venues who do not maintain their commitments.
